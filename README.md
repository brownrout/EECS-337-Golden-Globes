EECS 337 Project 1

Group 4: Eric Brownrout, Sonia Nigam, Shraya Soundararajan, Richard Gates Porter

External Libraries: 

- From the nltk corups, we imported stopwords, which gave us a list of high frequency words that could help us filter out unnecessary words from tweets.

- We also utilized the IMDbPY library: http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/ which gave us access to the IMDb movie database.

Reposotories: 

The only other repo we referenced was this: https://github.com/rmacedo1/EECS337_GG2015
